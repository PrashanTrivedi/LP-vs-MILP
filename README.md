# LP-vs-MILP
The simplest application of MILP is when the variables model discrete objects that can only take whole-number values (e.g. number of aeroplanes to manufacture). A commander in Indian Airforce needs to purchase aircraft for transporting goods and people. She wants to have maximum possible carrying capacity. Five different types of aircraft are available. Their capacities are 2; 1; 2; 1; 2 units per aircraft, respectively. The budget is limited to 13 units (say, crores). The costs per aircraft are 3; 3; 2; 2; 3 units, respectively. In addition, parking space is limited to 11 units. The space requirements per aircraft are 2; 1; 3; 1; 2 units, respectively. We model it using AMPL to findthe number of aircraft of each type that can be bought in order to maximize the goal. Sensitivity analysis is also carried out.
